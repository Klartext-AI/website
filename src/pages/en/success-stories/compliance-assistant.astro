const description = 'How an ATX company saves 80% time through intelligent compliance assistant with break-even after 2 months.';

const challenge = `
<p>In large organizations, compliance knowledge is often scattered across hundreds of documents. A leading ATX company with over 50 compliance guidelines, internal manuals, and process documents faced this challenge.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Employees had no overview of relevant guidelines when facing specific questions about processes or products</li>
  <li>Internal compliance experts lacked capacity to answer every inquiry with necessary sensitivity</li>
  <li>Searching through documents was time-consuming and often led to uncertain results</li>
  <li>Knowledge became outdated or was applied inconsistently</li>
</ul>

<p>The result: Slow decisions, employee uncertainty, expert overload.</p>
`;

const solution = `
<p>Building a "chatbot over documents" is easy. Developing an assistant that truly understands and gives reliable answers is a different challenge. This is where Domain-Driven Design comes into play.</p>

<p><strong>The Approach in Detail:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Integration of 50+ guidelines and documents:</strong> Complete capture of organizational knowledge</li>
  <li><strong>Knowledge Graph integration:</strong> Connection with company metadata for contextual intelligence</li>
  <li><strong>Intelligent retrieval methodology:</strong> Not just keyword search, but semantic understanding of relationships</li>
  <li><strong>Source citations with context:</strong> Every answer comes with precise reference from original documents</li>
  <li><strong>Complex inquiries:</strong> System can process multi-stage, interconnected queries</li>
</ul>

<p>What distinguishes this solution from generic RAG systems: The integration of company metadata (Knowledge Graph) enables context-aware retrieval. The AI doesn't just know what's in the documents, but also how different information relates.</p>
`;

const results = [
  "80% time and cost savings on compliance inquiries",
  "Break-even after just 2 months through reduced inquiries to experts",
  "Relief for compliance teams to focus on strategic topics",
  "Consistent compliance application across all departments",
  "Traceability for audits through complete source citations"

<h3>Knowledge Management Reimagined</h3>

<p><strong>Not search, but understanding:</strong> The solution doesn't just search for keywords but understands the intention behind questions and can explain complex relationships.</p>

<p><strong>Context is king:</strong> Through Knowledge Graph integration, the system knows which information is relevant in which context – depending on department, product, or process.</p>

<p><strong>Trust through transparency:</strong> Employees don't just get answers but also the reasoning and the exact location in the documents. This creates trust.</p>

<h3>What We Learned</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Retrieval is half the battle:</strong> Answer quality depends significantly on whether the right information is found. Simple vector search isn't enough.</li>
  <li><strong>Metadata is gold:</strong> Integrating company context (structure, processes, products) makes the difference between "works" and "works excellently".</li>
  <li><strong>Experts remain important:</strong> The AI doesn't replace compliance experts – it gives them freedom to work where their expertise truly counts.</li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation from the start:</strong> We measured how well the system answers from day 1. This was essential for rapid improvement.</li>
</ol>

<p>This solution is a prime example of Evaluation-Driven and Domain-Driven Development. Not "quickly build a chatbot," but systematically develop a solution that solves real business problems.</p>
