const challenge = `
<p>Success sometimes brings unexpected challenges. A manufacturing company received over 1000 standardized inquiries via email weekly – a clear sign of strong market position, but also an operational burden.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>1000+ inquiries per week, many very similar</li>
  <li>Manual quote creation ties up significant resources</li>
  <li>Time loss despite standardized products and recurring patterns</li>
  <li>Delays in response time affect customer satisfaction</li>
  <li>Employees waste time on repetitive tasks instead of strategic work</li>
</ul>
`;

const solution = `
<p>Instead of building a generic "quote generator," we analyzed what makes successful quotes work – and learned from it.</p>

<p><strong>The Approach in Detail:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Intelligent classification:</strong> Automatic categorization of incoming inquiries by type, product category, and complexity</li>
  <li><strong>Pattern recognition:</strong> Analysis of successful past quotes to identify success patterns</li>
  <li><strong>Automatic draft creation:</strong> AI generates promising and profitable quote drafts</li>
  <li><strong>Final human control:</strong> Employees efficiently review and finalize drafts</li>
  <li><strong>Continuous learning:</strong> System improves through feedback on accepted/rejected quotes</li>
</ul>

<p>What makes this solution special: It doesn't replace sales staff expertise but gives them back the time they need for strategic customer relationships.</p>

<h3>Domain-Driven Design Meets Sales</h3>

<p><strong>Sales is more than numbers:</strong> We didn't just look at prices and products but analyzed the entire sales logic: What makes a quote attractive? Which phrasings work? How are prices optimally positioned?</p>

<p><strong>Learning from success:</strong> Instead of generic templates, we taught the AI to recognize and apply patterns from successful quotes.</p>

<p><strong>Integration into existing processes:</strong> The solution fits seamlessly into the existing workflow – from email inbox to CRM integration.</p>

<h3>What We Learned</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Automation doesn't mean dehumanization:</strong> The best results come when AI handles routine and humans steer strategy.</li>
  <li><strong>Break-even isn't everything:</strong> The true value lies in scalability and the ability to keep pace with growth.</li>
  <li><strong>Classification is critical:</strong> The quality of automatic quotes depends heavily on correct inquiry classification.</li>
  <li><strong>Feedback loops are gold:</strong> Every finalized quote is an opportunity to improve the system.</li>
</ol>

<p>This solution is more than a "tool" – it's a strategic investment in scalability and efficiency. It shows that automation and personal service aren't opposites but can reinforce each other.</p>
