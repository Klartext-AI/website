const challenge = `
<p>A leading banking services provider faced a massive challenge: Analysts had to wade through 500+ page documents daily to extract quantitative and qualitative information for risk assessments. Every detail mattered, every error could be costly.</p>

<p>The manual process not only tied up significant resources but increasingly became a bottleneck for business-critical decisions. The central question wasn't whether automation was possible, but how it could work in such a sensitive area where errors are not an option.</p>
`;

const solution = `
<p>At Klartext AI, we know: In finance, "the AI says so" isn't enough. That's why we developed a solution that doesn't just extract, but also explains.</p>

<p><strong>The Solution in Detail:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Automated extraction</strong> of quantitative and qualitative data from complex documents</li>
  <li><strong>Intelligent verification:</strong> Every extraction comes with direct reference location in the original document</li>
  <li><strong>Reasoning engine:</strong> The AI delivers not just values, but the argumentation behind them</li>
  <li><strong>Seamless integration:</strong> Direct feed into existing systems without media breaks</li>
  <li><strong>Human-in-the-loop:</strong> Analysts can efficiently verify every extraction</li>
</ul>

<p>What sets us apart: We didn't just throw a generic LLM at the problem. Instead, we applied Domain-Driven Design and tailored the solution to the specific requirements of the banking sector – including regulatory compliance and audit trails.</p>
`;

const results = [
  "80% time and cost savings – what used to take hours is now done in minutes",
  "Break-even after just 1.5 months – fastest ROI in our portfolio",
  "Higher quality through consistency – no more overlooked details",
  "Scalability without additional effort – volume can increase easily",
  "Complete traceability – every extraction with source citation"
];

<h3>What We Learned</h3>

<p>Successful AI implementation in the financial sector requires three things:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Trust through transparency:</strong> Every AI decision must be traceable</li>
  <li><strong>Domain expertise:</strong> Generic solutions don't work in regulated industries</li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation-Driven Development:</strong> Systematic measurements from the start, not as an afterthought</li>
</ol>

<p>The solution is running in production today and has changed how our client works with documents. Not because the AI is perfect – but because it's transparent, reliable, and tailored to real business processes.</p>
