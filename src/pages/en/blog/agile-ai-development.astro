<p>"We need 6 more months, then the perfect model will be ready."</p>

<p>Wrong answer.</p>

<p>In those 6 months, the business has changed, requirements have shifted, and the chance for quick impact is missed.</p>

<p><strong>Agile AI Development means: Better to have a system with 80% accuracy in production today than one with 85% in development tomorrow.</strong></p>

<h4>The Waterfall Problem</h4>

<p>Traditional AI development often follows a waterfall model:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Gather requirements (3 months)</li>
  <li>Prepare data (2 months)</li>
  <li>Train model (4 months)</li>
  <li>Integrate system (3 months)</li>
  <li>Deployment (2 months)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>14 months later</strong>: A system based on requirements from over a year ago.</p>

<p><strong>The problem</strong>: By the time the system is ready, business, data, and requirements have long since changed.</p>

<h4>Agile Isn't Just for Software</h4>

<p>Agile methods were invented for software development. But they fit perfectly with AI projects – perhaps even better.</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong> Because AI is fundamentally iterative:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We can't guarantee quality in advance</li>
  <li>We learn through experiments, not specifications</li>
  <li>Feedback from real deployment is gold</li>
  <li>Requirements change when people use the system</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Agile AI means:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sprint 1-2:</strong> MVP with real data, even if only 70% accuracy<br/>
<strong>Sprint 3-4:</strong> Gather feedback, improve system<br/>
<strong>Sprint 5+:</strong> Iteratively optimize based on real usage data</p>

<h4>Small Cycles, Measurable Progress</h4>

<p>At Klartext AI, we work in 2-week sprints:</p>

<p><strong>Week 1-2:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Define clear, measurable sprint goals</li>
  <li>Implement features</li>
  <li>Test with real data</li>
  <li>Deploy to staging</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Review & Retrospective:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>What did we learn?</li>
  <li>What works well?</li>
  <li>What needs improvement?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Next sprint:</strong> Based on feedback and measurements</p>

<p><strong>The result</strong>: Continuous, measurable progress instead of months of development in the dark.</p>

<h4>Early and Often: Deploy early, deploy often</h4>

<p>The biggest mistake in AI projects: Waiting too long to deploy.</p>

<p><strong>Our philosophy:</strong> Deploy as early as possible, even if the system isn't perfect.</p>

<p>Why?</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Real feedback</strong> beats theoretical assumptions</li>
  <li><strong>Early adoption</strong> leads to earlier ROI</li>
  <li><strong>Fast iteration</strong> based on real problems</li>
  <li><strong>Reduced risk</strong> through smaller, more frequent changes</li>
</ul>

<p>A system with 75% accuracy that's productive today is more valuable than one with 90% accuracy in 6 months.</p>

<h4>Feedback Loops Are Key</h4>

<p>Agile without feedback is pointless. That's why we build feedback mechanisms from the start:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>User feedback</strong>: Direct feedback from users</li>
  <li><strong>System metrics</strong>: Automatic performance measurements</li>
  <li><strong>A/B tests</strong>: Comparisons of different approaches</li>
  <li><strong>Error analysis</strong>: Systematic error analysis</li>
</ul>

<p>Every piece of feedback flows into the next sprint.</p>

<h4>The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Principle</h4>

<p>We never start with the perfect system. We start with the MVP:</p>

<p><strong>Minimum:</strong> The smallest solution that delivers real value<br/>
<strong>Viable:</strong> Production-ready, not just a prototype<br/>
<strong>Product:</strong> An actually usable system</p>

<p><strong>Example Compliance Assistant:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>MVP (Sprint 1-2)</strong>: 20 most common questions, basic retrieval, manual review</li>
  <li><strong>V2 (Sprint 3-4)</strong>: 50 questions, Knowledge Graph, automatic sourcing</li>
  <li><strong>V3 (Sprint 5-6)</strong>: 100+ questions, multi-model ensemble, advanced evaluation</li>
</ul>

<p>Each version brings real value. Each version learns from feedback.</p>

<h4>The Uncomfortable Truth</h4>

<p>Agile AI Development requires courage:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Courage to deploy an imperfect system</li>
  <li>Courage to accept feedback</li>
  <li>Courage to change priorities</li>
  <li>Courage to say "no" to non-critical features</li>
</ul>

<p>But this courage is rewarded: With systems that are done faster, work better, and are actually used.</p>

<p><strong>At Klartext AI, we focus on speed without quality loss. On iteration over perfection. On feedback over assumptions.</strong></p>
