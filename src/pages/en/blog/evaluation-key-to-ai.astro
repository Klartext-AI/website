<p>"Does the AI work?" is the wrong question. The right one is: "How well does it work, in which cases, and how can we make it better?"</p>

<h4>The Prototype Fallacy</h4>

<p>We all know the phenomenon: An AI prototype shows impressive results in the demo. Everyone is excited. Then comes production deployment – and suddenly problems pile up. Why?</p>

<p>Because a working prototype is not the same as a production system. The prototype was tested with selected examples, the production system must handle reality – including all edge cases, inconsistencies, and unexpected inputs.</p>

<p><strong>The problem</strong>: Without systematic evaluation, we don't know where the system's boundaries lie. We don't know if 60% or 98% of requests are answered correctly. We don't know which error types occur and how critical they are.</p>

<h4>What Evaluation-Driven Engineering Means</h4>

<p>At Klartext AI, evaluation isn't a step at the end of the project – it's integrated from the start:</p>

<p><strong>1. Evaluation from Day 1</strong><br/>
Before we write the first line of code, we define: What does success mean? Which metrics matter? How do we measure quality, relevance, reliability?</p>

<p><strong>2. Continuous Measurement</strong><br/>
Evaluation isn't a one-time event but a continuous process. Every system change is measured. Every hypothesis is validated. No assumption without data.</p>

<p><strong>3. Transparency About Limits</strong><br/>
We communicate not just what the system can do, but also what it cannot do. Because only then can a system be used responsibly.</p>

<p><strong>4. Feedback Loops</strong><br/>
The best systems learn from feedback. But for that, you first need to capture, structure, and analyze feedback.</p>

<h4>Verifiability as an Accelerator</h4>

<p>Former Tesla AI director and OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy frames this shift as <em>Software 2.0</em>: "Software 2.0 easily automates what you can verify" (Karpathy, 2024, <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1990116666194456651.html?utm_source=tldrai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Threadreader</a>). Software 1.0 automated whatever we could explicitly specify leading to deterministic outputs; Software 2.0 automates what we can reliably verify, based on probabilistic LLMs. Karpathy's core insight - "The more a task/job is verifiable, the more amenable it is to automation in the new programming paradigm" - explains why we treat evaluation as a product capability. We design resettable environments, tight feedback loops, and crisp acceptance criteria so AI-infused software improves every iteration while preserving measurable quality.</p>

<h4>Why So Many AI Projects Fail</h4>

<p>According to MIT's <em>State of AI in Business 2025</em> report (MIT, 2025, <a href="https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a>), 95% of GenAI projects achieve no measurable business impact. Not because the technology doesn't work, but because:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>No clear success criteria</strong> – What does "better" mean? Faster? More accurate? More relevant?</li>
  <li><strong>Missing measurements</strong> – You can't optimize what you don't measure</li>
  <li><strong>No baseline</strong> – Without knowing where you start, you can't measure progress</li>
  <li><strong>Ignoring edge cases</strong> – The 5% exceptional cases that cause 80% of problems</li>
</ul>

<h4>A Real-World Example</h4>

<p>With our Compliance Assistant for an ATX company, we didn't just "build a system". We:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Compiled 200 test questions</strong> from real compliance inquiries</li>
  <li><strong>Defined expert answers</strong> as the gold standard</li>
  <li><strong>Established multidimensional metrics</strong>: Correctness, completeness, source quality, response time</li>
  <li><strong>Conducted and documented weekly evaluations</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Ran A/B tests</strong> for every major system update</li>
</ol>

<p>The result: A system that doesn't just "work" but whose performance we know precisely – and continuously improve.</p>

<h4>The Hard Truth</h4>

<p>Evaluation-Driven Engineering is demanding. It takes time. It means documenting and communicating system weaknesses. It's uncomfortable when tests show that a new idea performs <em>worse</em> than the old solution.</p>

<p>But it's the only way to get from a prototype to a productive, reliable system.</p>

<h4>No Decision Without Data</h4>

<p>In the end, it's about a simple philosophy: <strong>No decision without data, no assumption without validation.</strong></p>

<p>AI isn't magic. It's engineering. And good engineering is based on measurements, facts, and continuous improvement.</p>

<p>The projects that fail are often those that evade this truth. The projects that succeed are those that make evaluation a core competency.</p>

<p><strong>At Klartext AI, we don't measure just because it sounds good. We measure because it's the only way to deliver real quality.</strong></p>
